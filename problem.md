UI Coding Problem: Excel Sheet

Problem Statement

Part 1: Build a simple excel sheet in HTML/CSS/JS.

- Start with a 10x10 grid / table, but your code should scale to handle 1000x1000 also.
- Users can select a cell by clicking on it. The currently selected cell should be highlighted.
- Users can input a string/number in a selected cell.

Part 2: Implement a SUM function.

- A cell can specify a formula such as SUM:A1,A2,A3 (feel free to change exact syntax to
  make it simple).
- It should calculate the sum of the specified cells and update the current cell. If some
  values are invalid numbers, assume 0.
- If one of the cells specified in the formula changes, the sum should also update.

Coding Expectations

- Demonstrable code is a must!
- You can use any library/framework of your choice. Feel free to Google if required.
- Handle edge cases correctly.
- Thinking Performance is important in this question.
- Code should be simple, clean and professional. Handle modularity where applicable.
- Use of ES6 and modern frontend constructs is encouraged.
- Total limit is 90 mins. Time is your most limited resource, so manage it well!
